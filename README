=================================

Mobster v0.2 (ALPHA)

=================================

Plugin Hierarchy:
The MobsterPlugin is the main class and handles the basic plugin load/enable/disable functions. The Mobster class handles and keeps track of all the dungeons. Each dungeon has a MobsterDungeon class with a MobsterRoom class for each room in the dungeon. Spawners in each room are handled by MobsterSpawner (might be changed).
